#Feautures
Using this Editor I have created two projects
1) Basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript - this includes HTML, CSS and JavaScript codes to show how this editor works. As you write the code in the editor area you will see live results in the output field
   
   Code Structure
   * htmlcode.html- This includes the HTML code for this project
   * csscode.css- The CSS code is written in this file
   * jscode.js- The JavaScript file in which you can switch between light and dark mode.

2) Toggle game - Using Javascript features I have build a toggle game in which by clicking the button of a specific colour your background colour will change to that colour.
   
 How to play?
1. Open the CodeSpace app
2. Open togglegame.html file in the web browser
3. Click on the coloured button to change the background colour
   
   Code Structure
   * togglegame.html- The main HTML file for the game
   * togglegame.css- The CSS file for Styling
   * togglegame.js- The JavaScript file for game logic and interactions
